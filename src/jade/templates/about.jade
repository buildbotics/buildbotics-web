h1 About Buildbotics

h2 Our Mission
p
  | Our main goal is to make desktop manufacturing easier.  CNC, 3D printers and
  | LASER cutters are awesome tools but using them can be both expensive and
  | challenging.  Fortunately, many companies are beginning to produce
  | relatively inexpensive machines but the software and controllers that run
  | them are either very costly and difficult to use or poor quality and
  | lacking features.  We believe desktop manufacturing is for everyone.

h2 The Company
p
  | Buildbotics LLC is located in Petaluma, CA.  It’s founders Joe and
  | Doug Coffland are related as Nephew and Uncle. They founded the company
  | in 2014 and began work on the Buildbotics CNC controller in 2015.
  | Both have extensive engineering experience.
