h1 The best in Open-Source CNC control
p
  | The Buildbotics CNC controller controller achieves record breaking
  | speeds on existing DIY hardware while setting a new bar for
  | reliability. This controller's flexibility makes it easy to construct
  | CNC mills, 3D printers and LASER cutters, opening the world of high
  | performance benchtop-scale manufacturing to many new Makers.

include ../mailinglist.jade

p
  | While many Maker tools have advanced at a rapid pace, CNC builders
  | have come to expect Open-Source CNC controllers to come as unassembled
  | kits, often with exposed circuit boards. The Buildbotics controller is
  | <i>different</i>. It is protected by a rugged aluminum box and comes
  | with it’s own cables for connecting stepper motors and a wide array of
  | cutting and extruding tools.

h1 Reliable

p
  | In CNC control applications, reliability is a huge concern. Yet, many
  | inexpensive CNC controllers were designed with little or no attention
  | to electrical safety. The Buildbotics controller is protected from
  | short-circuits, reverse voltage
  | and current overloads. Thermal protection was also considered. Due to
  | the careful selection of high-quality electronic components, the
  | controller does not need a fan to cool itself, even while driving 6
  | amp motor loads. Going fanless not only eliminates noise but also
  | avoids sucking in dust and debris.

h1 Easy to setup, easy to use
p
  | Working with CNCs may seem daunting but we belive now is the time for CNCs
  | to enter the mainstream.  We've made both setting up and using a CNC with
  | the Buildbotics controller incredably easy with our rugged aluminum
  | enclosure, premade cables and simple Web based configuration.

h1 Dedicated computer not required

p
  | The typical lack of electrical protection in previous Open-Source CNC
  | controllers has earned them a poor reputation. For this reason, CNC
  | builders often still rely on decades old stepper motor drivers which,
  | although robust, lack modern features or even basic
  | programmability. Such drivers are tethered to a dedicated desktop PC
  | over a <i>printer</i> cable. Just finding a computer with a printer
  | port is difficult these days and tuning a PC to produce stepper motor
  | pulses which are both smooth and fast is a black art.

h1 Wired or WiFi Networking

p
  | The Buildbotics controller, on the other hand, offers a modern Web
  | interface accessible from a browser over a local network or WiFi. It’s
  | dedicated hardware is able to achieve smooth step rates in excess of
  | <i>250,000 per second</i>, with no tuning. CNC programs, even
  | gigabytes in size, can be uploaded to the controller and run without
  | further support from the remote computer. Whole networks of
  | Buildbotics controllers can be managed from a single laptop computer.

h1 Camera, Gamepad, VFDs. . .

p A whole slew of features are now available in one package, including:
ul
  li Remote monitoring by USB web camera.
  li Tool head positioning via a USB gamepad.
  li Spindle speed control with PWM.
  li Full control of high-speed VFD spindle drivers over built-in RS485.
  li
    | Heated 3D printer bed or coolant system control via two 15 amp
    | switches.

h1 Software Included

p
  | Supporting software includes the impressive Open-Source CNC simulator,
  | CAMotics. CAMotics displays 3D previews of the cut workpiece. After
  | sending GCode directly to the controller, it shows continuously
  | updated tool position and time estimates. Compatible software like
  | FreeCAD, LibreCAD and Inkscape provide a completely Open-Source
  | toolchain for designing, simulating and running CNC jobs.

h1 RaspberryPi 3 Inside

p
  | Inclusion of a Raspberry Pi 3 running Linux and a 16GiB microSD card
  | is particularly exciting. This platform has massive potential for
  | integration with existing Open-Source software. For example, a
  | high-speed pick-n-place machine with camera support could be quickly
  | realized through integration with the OpenPnP project. Integrations
  | with Octoprint and LaserWeb are also on the horizon.

include ../docs.jade

p
  | Good documentation is essential.  We are still working on perfecting our
  | documentation and will continue to do so.  If you have any suggestions
  | on how we can improve, please let us know.

h1 Tested

p
  | This controller has already been successfully
  | tested in several CNC builds. We built and
  | filmed the construction of a Taig CNC mill, an OX CNC router, a K40
  | LASER upgrade and a Dyna Myte 2400 retrofit. So far, the results are
  | impressive. We achieved a record breaking speed on the OX of 2,000
  | inches per minute shortly after the machine was assembled. We have
  | released these films on our <a

  | Youtube channel</a>.

h1 Stepper Motors

img(src="images/steppers.png")

p
  | The Buildbotics controller contains four highly reliable stepper motor
  | drivers with the following specs:

ul
  li Up to 6A per channel
  li 12v to 36v DC
  li Up to 128 microstepping
  li Smooth S-curve acceleration
  li At step rates in excess of 250k/sec per channel.

p
  | It is suitable for driving NEMA 17, NEMA 23 and many NEMA 34
  | motors. We currently only support 3-axis Cartesian machines but
  | preliminary support for a 4th rotary axis is underway. The fourth
  | driver can also be synchronized to drive a single axis with two
  | motors.

h1 Tools

img(src="images/spindles.png")

p
  | The PWM, enable and direction outputs can be used to control a wide
  | array of tool heads. The RS485 connection drives high-speed VFD
  | controlled air and water cooled spindles over two wires.

h1 DB25 M2 Breakout Board
img(width=500, src="images/DB25-M2_breakout.png")

p
  | Limit switches, Z-axis probing, PWM spindle control, RS-485 spindle
  | control, and e-stop switches can be easily connected via a 25-pin I/O
  | breakout board using simple screw terminals. This is <b>not a parallel
  | port</b>.

h1 Power Supplies

img(src="images/power_supplies.png")

p
  | We really like Meanwell power supplies because they are reliable and
  | not too expensive. We especially like their power adapters which plug
  | directly into the Buildbotics controller. Any power supply which
  | outputs 12-36v DC, with at least 6A, can be easily connected with our
  | custom power cable.

h1 Custom Cables

img(src="images/cables.png")

p
  | The Buildbotics controller kits come with pre-made cables for
  | connecting stepper motors, power supplies and load switches. These
  | cables really save time.

h1 USB Devices

img(src="images/usb_devs.png")

p
  | Inexpensive <b>gamepads</b> can be used for tool head positioning and
  | navigating LCD menus. Plug into a USB port to jog the machine
  | axes. Plug in a <b>USB camera</b> and keep an eye on your machines
  | from a Web browser

h1 Networking Options

video(autoplay, loop, width=600)
  source(src="video/network_blink.mp4", type="video/mp4")

p
  | Wired Ethernet provides reliable network communication even in noisy
  | environments. USB WiFi dongles can also be used to put your machines
  | on the network.

h1 External Load Switches

img(src="images/load_switch.png")

p
  | Two load switches, each capable of supplying up to 15A can power
  | heated beds for 3D printers, extruders, vacuum tables or whatever else
  | you can think of. For AC loads an inexpensive <a
  | href="https://www.amazon.com/s/?field-keywords=solid+state+relay"
  | >SSR</a> switch can be used and relays can be used for higher amp DC
  | loads.

h1 Aluminum Enclosure

img(src="images/enclosure.png")

p
  | Heat dissipation was carefully considered throughout the design. As a
  | result, the fan-less aluminum enclosure dissipates heat without
  | pulling in metal and wood shavings. <a href="https://blog.hackster.io/buildbotics-open-source-cnc-controller-d21a2ccb15f6"
  | >Check out what hackster.io blogger, Jeremy Cook had to say</a>.

blockquote
  | "Buildbotics' open source controller looks like [a] really solid
  | solution for controlling CNC," says blogger <a

  | >Jeremy S. Cook of hackster.io</a>. "If you have a CNC build or
  | retrofit in your future, it's certainly worth checking out!"

img(src="images/buildbotics_enclosure_base.png")

p
  | Four screw holes allow the enclosure to be easily mounted on or near
  | the machine.

h1 Reliability Features

p
  | We have put a lot of thought into making a robust device that not only
  | protects its own internal electronics but also the devices connected
  | to it. Here’s a list of some of the reliability features:

ul
  li Over current protection
  li Over temperature shutdown
  li Under voltage lockout
  li Reverse voltage protection
  li Short-circuit protection
