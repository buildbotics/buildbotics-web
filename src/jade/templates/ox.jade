  | When we paired the Buildbotics controller with a <a
  | href="https://www.smw3d.com/ox-cnc-kit/">large format OX CNC</a>
  | we were surprised by itâ€™s speed. Simply by connecting up the motors
  | and configuring them using the Buildbotics Web interface, we were able
  | to reach speeds of 2,000 IPM (50,000 mm/min) and stop smoothly before
  | hitting the other side.
