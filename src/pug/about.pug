      h1 About Buildbotics LLC

      h2 Our Mission
      p.
        Our main goal is to make desktop manufacturing easier.  CNC, 3D
        printers and LASER cutters are awesome tools but using them can be both
        expensive and challenging.  Fortunately, many companies are beginning to
        produce relatively inexpensive machines but the software and controllers
        that run them are either very costly and difficult to use or poor
        quality and lacking features.  We believe desktop manufacturing is for
        everyone.

      h2 The Company
      p.
        Buildbotics LLC is located in Petaluma, CA.  It’s founders Joe and
        Doug Coffland are related as Nephew and Uncle. They founded the company
        in 2014 and began work on the Buildbotics CNC controller in 2015.
        Both have extensive engineering experience.
