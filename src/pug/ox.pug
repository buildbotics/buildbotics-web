      p.
        When we paired the Buildbotics controller with a
        #[a(href="https://www.smw3d.com/ox-cnc-kit/") large format OX CNC]
        we were surprised by itâ€™s speed. Simply by connecting up the motors
        and configuring them using the Buildbotics Web interface, we were able
        to reach speeds of 2,000 IPM (50,000 mm/min) and stop smoothly before
        reaching the other side.
