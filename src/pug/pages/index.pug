  h1 Easy to setup, easy to use
  p
    | Setting up a CNC control system may seem daunting but the Buildbotics
    | controller makes it incredibly easy.  Our rugged aluminum enclosure and
    | premade cables make integration with your CNC a breeze.  And our
    | intuitive Web based configuration and control are easy to get the hang of.

  h1 Reliable Electronics

  img(src="images/electrical_warning.png")

  p.
    We know you want your CNC to just work when you need it it.  Yet, many
    inexpensive CNC controllers were designed with little or no attention
    to electrical safety. The Buildbotics controller is protected from
    short-circuits, reverse voltage, current overloads and the intense
    voltage spikes that occur during motor stalls.

  img(src="images/cool_without_fan.png")

  p.
    The Buildbotics controller actively protects against thermal overload.
    Through careful selection of high-quality electronic components, the
    Buildbotics controller stays cool, with out at fan, even while driving 6A
    motor loads. Going fanless not only eliminates noise but also
    avoids sucking in dust and debris.

  h1 Dedicated computer not required

  img(src="images/no_mach3_or_linuxcnc.png")

  p.
    A finely tuned PC running Mach3, Mach4 or LinuxCNC is #[b not]
    needed with the Buildbotics CNC controller.  Everything these programs do
    is built in.  Not will you save money and space in your shop, you can be
    sure that other software cannot interrupt your CNC runs.  And because the
    path planning and step generation are tightly coupled in the controller you
    will get maximum performance and accuracy from your CNC.

  h1 Wired or WiFi Networking

  p
    | The Buildbotics controller, on the other hand, offers a modern Web
    | interface accessible from a browser over a local network or WiFi. It’s
    | dedicated hardware is able to achieve smooth step rates in excess of
    | <i>250,000 per second</i>, with no tuning. CNC programs, even
    | gigabytes in size, can be uploaded to the controller and run without
    | further support from the remote computer. Whole networks of
    | Buildbotics controllers can be managed from a single laptop computer.

  p A whole slew of features are now available in one package, including:
  ul
    li Remote monitoring by USB web camera.
    li Tool head positioning via a USB gamepad.
    li Spindle speed control with PWM.
    li Full control of high-speed VFD spindle drivers over built-in RS485.
    li
      | Heated 3D printer bed or coolant system control via two 15 amp
      | switches.

  h1 Software Included

  p
    | Supporting software includes the impressive Open-Source CNC simulator,
    | CAMotics. CAMotics displays 3D previews of the cut workpiece. After
    | sending GCode directly to the controller, it shows continuously
    | updated tool position and time estimates. Compatible software like
    | FreeCAD, LibreCAD and Inkscape provide a completely Open-Source
    | toolchain for designing, simulating and running CNC jobs.

  h1 RaspberryPi 3 Inside

  p
    | Inclusion of a Raspberry Pi 3 running Linux and a 16GiB microSD card
    | is particularly exciting. This platform has massive potential for
    | integration with existing Open-Source software. For example, a
    | high-speed pick-n-place machine with camera support could be quickly
    | realized through integration with the OpenPnP project. Integrations
    | with Octoprint and LaserWeb are also on the horizon.

  a(name="docs")
  h1 Documented

  include ../docs.pug

  p
    | Good documentation is essential.  We are still working on perfecting our
    | documentation and will continue to do so.  If you have any suggestions
    | on how we can improve, please let us know.

  h1 Tested

  p
    | This controller has already been successfully
    | tested in several CNC builds. We built and
    | filmed the construction of a Taig CNC mill, an OX CNC router, a K40
    | LASER upgrade and a Dyna Myte 2400 retrofit. So far, the results are
    | impressive. We achieved a record breaking speed on the OX of 2,000
    | inches per minute shortly after the machine was assembled. We have
    | released these films on our <a
    | href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_onc2im9IrG1RxJ3CZnArw">

  h1 Stepper Motors

  img(src="images/steppers.png")

  p
    | The Buildbotics controller contains four highly reliable stepper motor
    | drivers with the following specs:

  ul
    li Up to 6A per channel
    li 12v to 36v DC
    li Up to 128 microstepping
    li Smooth S-curve acceleration
    li At step rates in excess of 250k/sec per channel.

  p
    | It is suitable for driving NEMA 17, NEMA 23 and many NEMA 34
    | motors. We currently only support 3-axis Cartesian machines but
    | preliminary support for a 4th rotary axis is underway. The fourth
    | driver can also be synchronized to drive a single axis with two
    | motors.

  h1 Tools

  img(src="images/spindles.png")

  p
    | The PWM, enable and direction outputs can be used to control a wide
    | array of tool heads. The RS485 connection drives high-speed VFD
    | controlled air and water cooled spindles over two wires.

  a(name="breakout")
  h1 DB25 Breakout Box
  img(src="images/DB25_breakout_box.png")

  p
    | Limit switches, Z-axis probing, PWM spindle control, RS-485 spindle
    | control, and e-stop switches can be easily connected via a 25-pin I/O
    | breakout board using simple screw terminals. This is <b>not a parallel
    | port</b>.

  h1 Power Supplies

  img(src="images/power_supplies.png")

  p
    | We really like Meanwell power supplies because they are reliable and
    | not too expensive. We especially like their power adapters which plug
    | directly into the Buildbotics controller. Any power supply which
    | outputs 12-36v DC, with at least 6A, can be easily connected with our
    | custom power cable.

  h1 Custom Cables

  img(src="images/cables.png")

  p
    | The Buildbotics controller kits come with pre-made cables for
    | connecting stepper motors, power supplies and load switches. These
    | cables really save time.

  h1 USB Devices

  img(src="images/usb_devs.png")

  p
    | Inexpensive <b>gamepads</b> can be used for tool head positioning and
    | navigating LCD menus. Plug into a USB port to jog the machine
    | axes. Plug in a <b>USB camera</b> and keep an eye on your machines
    | from a Web browser

  h1 Networking Options

  video(autoplay, loop, width=600)
    source(src="video/network_blink.mp4", type="video/mp4")

  p
    | Wired Ethernet provides reliable network communication even in noisy
    | environments. USB WiFi dongles can also be used to put your machines
    | on the network.

  h1 External Load Switches

  img(src="images/load_switch.png")

  p
    | Two load switches, each capable of supplying up to 15A can power
    | heated beds for 3D printers, extruders, vacuum tables or whatever else
    | you can think of. For AC loads an inexpensive <a
    | href="https://www.amazon.com/s/?field-keywords=solid+state+relay"
    | >SSR</a> switch can be used and relays can be used for higher amp DC
    | loads.

  h1 Aluminum Enclosure

    | Heat dissipation was carefully considered throughout the design. As a
    | result, the fan-less aluminum enclosure dissipates heat without
    | pulling in metal and wood shavings.

    "Buildbotics' open source controller looks like [a] really solid
    solution for controlling CNC," says blogger
    #[a(href=hackster) Jeremy S. Cook of hackster.io]. "If you have a
    CNC build or retrofit in your future, it's certainly worth checking out!"

    the machine.

  h1 Reliability Features

  p.
    We have put a lot of thought into making a robust device that not only
    protects its own internal electronics but also the devices connected
    to it. Here’s a list of some of the reliability features:

  ul
    li Over current protection
    li Over temperature shutdown
    li Under voltage lockout
    li Reverse voltage protection
    li Short-circuit protection
