      When I started to build my first DIY machine 3 months ago what I feared
      the most was the controller part. This plug and play controller can
      support large stepper motors, can control a VFD and have an user-friendly
      interface.

      I can only highly recommend this product and its customer service.

      Greetings from Belgium,

      Antoine

      The Buildbotics CNC Controller is Amazing.  I have a CNC with a controller
      built by another company and it is like comparing a cadillac to a chevy,
      both will get you there but there is a world of difference in the ride.
      I have thrown y old controller away.  The buildbotics comes with local
      network wifi compatibility so you can control the controller from
      anywhere in the house.  This is a huge advantage since no one wants to
      sit in a room with all the sawdust, noise and laser smoke.  Most
      controllers lack PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) but the buildbotics comes
      with it standard.  PWM allows you to modify your CNC to use a LED laser
      at its fullest capability to burn pictures that are accurate and true- on
      request I can send some pictures I have burned.  The setup and controls
      are intuitive and well designed.  You can tell a lot of thought went into
      its design, for instance, the control screen gives you both the time the
      machine will finish the cut/laser as well as a countdown until it is
      done- and it is totally accurate.  It also has an onscreen mockup that
      will show the machine cutting/lasering the proposed project.  It will
      tell you the percentage of completion and it comes with a game controller
      which makes moving the spindle/laser to the right spot a breeze.   It
      also seems to control the motors in a much smoother fashion then my old
      controller.  It comes with the optional add-on camera (which I recommend
      purchasing)so you can see precisely what is happening.  If you use this
      for a laser it is comforting to know that the house isn\'t burning down.
      Technical support is also phenomenal.  Doug will spend any length of time,
      at virtually anytime of the day to help solve any issues you might be
      experiencing.  I recommend this unit without reservation.  It is well
      worth the money and hard to appreciate until you actual use it.

      I am totally impressed with your Buildbotics controller.   I have been
      looking for a solution to replace the controller for my 6040T CNC machine
      for several months and feel I have found the perfect solution.  My CNC
      machine itself works well, but the stock controller is poorly constructed
      and leaves a lot to be desired in functionality.  I looked at a number of
      different solutions, but I was not finding anything that would both
      replace what I had, without having to connect a jumble of \'things\'
      together, and also simplify the work flow.

      When I found the Buildbotics controller, I was skeptical at first and had
      a few questions which were quickly answered by Doug.  Based upon that
      discussion, I decided to make the purchase.  I received the controller in
      a couple of days and was able to get it setup within a few hours (most of
      the time was spent adapting the cables to my machine.)

      After running it through its paces, I am very happy with the controller
      and pleasantly surprised at how much better my 3 year old CNC machine is
      running.  The Buildbotics controller resolved a couple of issues with the
      stock controller and the various software packages that I have been
      dealing with for years.  With one of the software packages, it would slow
      down to the point of burning or leaving an indent when transitioning
      between a line and an arc requiring extra time to sand out.  An
      additional issue I dealt with was when the steppers were cold (< 50
      degrees) they would miss steps or not even move (sort of vibrate back and
      forth) when the feed rate was less than 200 mm/minute, which created an
      even bigger mess.

      The Buildbotics controller runs at an almost constant feed rate which
      leaves a much smoother finish and more importantly requires less sanding.
      I also tested when the steppers were below 40 degrees at a feed rate of
      25 mm/minute and it did not miss a step.  The stepper motors run quieter
      and seem to run cooler, and my system now has a better and more confident
      feel.

      I have also found that having the software, hardware, and stepper drivers
      in a single package eliminates the complexity and compatibility issues I
      previously experienced.  Being able to control it from a web page on the
      same system where I do my design work eliminates a lot of steps (both
      back and forth to the garage and in the workflow.)  I am sure I will find
      a lot more to love about this controller as I continue to use it.  From
      my experience, I would highly recommend this controller, and the guys at
      Buildbotics have been great to work with. They are extremely responsive
      and knowledgeable - a pleasantly unique experience in this industry.

      After a lot of internet searches and chat room conversations I felt that
      your product should be the easiest to use. Being new at retrofits, I
      didn\'t want something complicated. I have to say I was more than
      impressed at the ease of assembly and a lower price than the diy kits!
      It took longer to haul the old monitor out of the closet than to set up
      the steppers. Not only did everything work as promised, but the service
      was excellent! I ordered my unit and it was shipped that morning!

      I expect to see great things from such a service and quality oriented
      business!

      I bought a used Dyna Myte 2400 mini CNC milling machine couple weeks ago
      but found out later that the controller doesn\'t have its computer
      software and the company is out of business. I decided to update the
      controller and after some internet search found that buildbotics
      controller is very capable. I asked customer service some questions
      before I bought and Doug was extremely helpful and told me what the
      controller can and cannot do. Also some useful tips. So I ordered it and
      two days later I got it in my mailbox. The machine also come with pre
      made cables that are very easy to connect. I had experience with other
      DIY CNC controller and it usually have a separate break out board and
      driver board which is a nightmare to mount everything together. The
      buildbotics controller is super clean after all the wiring because of a
      single unit controller. Also I found that the game pad is very handy to
      jog around the axes. The biggest surprise to me is how the remote web
      browser works, it is extremely easy to setup and control. So definitely
      recommend buildbotics controller for CNC control!

      Also I want mention that Doug was extremely helpful and patient, I am not
      a very experienced CNC machine guy but with Doug\'s instruction and
      wiring diagram, I felt the whole conversion process requires much less
      effort and time. I spent 4 hours to wire everything on my Dyna and half
      hour to setup the buildbotics controller. I couldn\'t done that without
      Doug\'s help. Thank you Doug!

      After all my Dyna was alive again and I tested it using the sample G code
      from buildbotics. And everything is good as what it should be. I felt
      great to see the old machine becoming very capable with buildbotics
      controller.  Thank you buildbotics for the great CNC controller!

      Xin from Michigan.
