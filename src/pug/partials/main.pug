    h1 Reliable Electronics
    .img-right: img(src="images/electrical_warning.png")
    p.
      We know you want your CNC to just work when you need it to.  Yet, many
      cheap CNC controllers were designed with little or no attention
      to electrical safety. The Buildbotics controller is protected from:

    ul
      li Over-current
      li Thermal overload
      li Under voltage
      li Reverse voltage
      li Short-circuit
      li Voltage spikes caused by motor stalls

  section
    h1 Stay Cool even without a Fan
    .img-left: img(src="images/cool_without_fan.png")

    p.
      The Buildbotics controller protects against thermal overload.
      Through careful selection of high-quality electronic components, the
      Buildbotics controller stays cool, without a fan, even while driving 6A
      motor loads. Going fan-less not only eliminates noise but also avoids
      sucking in dust and debris.

  section
    h1 Dedicated Computer #[b not] Required
    .img-left: img(src="images/no_mach3_or_linuxcnc.png")

    p.
      A finely tuned PC running Mach or LinuxCNC is #[b not] needed.  All of
      the control software is built in so you can be sure that your CNC
      will run smoothly and uninterrupted.

    p Even very large GCode programs run without support from a remote computer.

  section
    h1 Fast, Smooth & Accurate Stepping
    .img-left: img(src="images/stepdir.gif")

    p.
      Get maximum performance and accuracy from your CNC. The Buildbotics
      controller achieves smooth step rates up to #[i 250,000 per second]
      allowing you to use up to 256 microstepping at high speeds.

  section
    h1 Wired or WiFi Networking
    p.
      The Buildbotics controller offers a modern Web interface accessible from
      a browser over your local network or WiFi.  A whole network of
      Buildbotics controllers can be managed from a single computer.

  section
    h1 Free Simulation Software
    p.
      All the software you need to run GCode on your CNC machine is built
      in to the Buildbotics controller but you can also use our free
      simulation software to test your GCode before you run it.

    p.
      The #[a(href="https://camotics.org/", target="_blank") CAMotics] CNC
      simulator computes 3D cut previews from GCode.  CAMotics can also send
      GCode directly to the Buildbotics controller over the network and track
      the machine position while it runs.

    .img-right: img(src="images/spindles.png")
    p.
      The PWM, enable and direction outputs can be used to control a wide
      array of tool heads. The RS485 connection drives high-speed VFD
      controlled air or water cooled spindles over two wires.

      Connect any power supply which outputs 12-36v DC with at least 6A using
      the included power cable or buy the Mean Well GST280A-C6P power adapter
      on our store for a totally enclosed fan-less option.

  section
    h1 Cables Included
    .img-right: img(src="images/cables.png")

    p.
      Wired Ethernet provides reliable network communication even in noisy
      environments. The built-in WiFi can also be used to put your CNC on the
      network.

  section
    h1 Switch External Loads
    .img-right: img(src="images/load_switch.png")
    p
      | Two load switches, each capable of supplying up to 15A can power
      | heated beds for 3D printers, extruders, vacuum tables or whatever else
      | you can think of.  For AC loads an inexpensive
      a(href="https://www.amazon.com/s/?field-keywords=solid+state+relay") SSR
      |  switch can be used.  External relays can be used for higher amp
      | DC loads.

  section
    h1 Aluminum Enclosure
    .img-right: img(src="images/enclosure.png")
    p.
      By carefully considering heat throughout the design process the
      Buildbotics controller dissipates heat through its fan-less aluminum
      enclosure without sucking in metal or wood shavings.

    .clear
    .img-right: img(src="images/buildbotics_enclosure_base.png")
    p.
      Four screw holes allow the enclosure to be easily mounted on or near
      the machine.
